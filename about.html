<h2>Welcome to my About Page</h2><br>
<br><br><img src="profile.jpg" width="275" height="350" alt="profilepic"><br><br><br>      
<p>
My name is Kenny, I grew up in regional Victoria in Australia (The land down under).
When I turned 21, I joined the Australian Navy which led me to moving to the big smoke being Sydney, Australia. 
Following this move, I joined an operational Ship/Vessel and travelled around Australia and was lucky enough to deploy overseas
to the Middle East where we conducted patrols around the Persian Gulf. Currently the Afghanistan War had been going for several years and there was a lot of combat
taking place and multiple casualties to all who were involved.
Fortunately, I didn't see front-line combat, so I was relatively safe for the whole operation/deployment, however I learned a lot about different cultures and saw
the world as it really was this being a scary place and a dangerous place. 
In saying that, the Military was a big part of my life, I had some great experiences, good times, cherished memories and as a result of this experience, 
I met a lot of amazing people who I still see today and am the closest of friends with. The Australian Defence Force made me the person I am today and because of
this I have had a successful working life, learned how to navigate this thing called life and have created an amazing family. 
</p> 
<p>
After 5 years of serving in the Navy, I decided it was time to move on. I landed a job in the the Landscaping Industry after obtaining an Advanced Diploma in this field.
I worked as a member of the construction team and was planning to work in the design part of Landscape down the track. I gave it a go, but never managed to complete a Design certificate or 
similar. I have some regrets that I didn't get to this stage but I believe that within life it is necessary to get to a place where everything works out and fulfillment, enjoyment and work-life balance comes from 
our workplace.
</p>
Following this, I lost interest in Landscape Industry and felt I needed to get back to my mindset of when I joined the military. This being a sense of purpose and job satisfaction, and as a result
it led me to joining the State Police in Melbourne, Australia. I have been doing this for several years now, but I still believe in continuing to upskill and learn a variety of things. Policing has a variety of pathways to follow but as 
with all jobs you have to start at the bottom. The pathway for me is a computer-based role within the Policing world or if this doesn't work out then joining an IT company as a Software Developer or similar,
which leads me to where I am right now. I am studying Front End Development and once I receive my certification in this area, I will look for part-time work within this sector or start off freelancing until I get the valued exposure and experience 
required to land me a long-term position doing just that. Iâ€™m grateful for all the opportunities I have had in life and look forward to continuing to become a better person and professional alike.  
</p>     
          
<p>Hopefully I haven't bored you with my story, I have a lot of other things happening in my life that weren't mentioned but in relation to my portfolio are irrelevant and not needed. This is me and I hope you enjoy the webpage. </p>
